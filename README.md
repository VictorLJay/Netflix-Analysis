## Project Description
I'm a huge fan of Netflix and, mostly of all, I love watch series. After scrolling on the platform
I thought that they are focusing their content in a more series-based rather than films.

## Questions & Hypotheses
With this project I want to answer the following questions:
1. Is Netflix more series-based rather than films?
2. Which is the content people enjoys more?
3. Is there any correlation between the content from one country to another?

## Dataset
There are three datasets obtained from Kaggle (listed below) and web scrapping from IMDb to obtain the ratings.
1. Main Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv)
2. Streaming platform Movies (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney)
3. Streaming platform Series (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney)

## Workflow
First of all, I had to clean all the datasets to make them useful and able to merge them together.
Secondly, I merged all the datasets in just one file.
Third, I started the data analysis using Tableau.

## Organization
The project has been organized through Trello linked on the next headline.
